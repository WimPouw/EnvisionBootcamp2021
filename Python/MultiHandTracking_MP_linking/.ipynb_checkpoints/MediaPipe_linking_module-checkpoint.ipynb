    "<h3> Introduction </h3>\n",
    "The tricky thing about acquiring motion tracking data for only hands, when there are multiple individuals being recorded, is that we may not know who the hands belong to, or even whether a hand tracked in one frame is the same as a hand tracked in the previous. This is especially difficult when we have missing data, where some frames will have more tracked hands than others. We demonstrate one way to resolve this issue, using a simple distance based approach. <br>\n",
